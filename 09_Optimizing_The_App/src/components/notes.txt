distribute code into small small part and make modular fashion I we follow single responsible principle code 
 So code will be easy for maintain and testing and Reusable code

// Custom Hooks (We make customs hooks for single responsible code)
//In the end of the hooks is normal utility function

//eg. in RestaurantCardMenu component I used a useEffect and then after I am set data on UI.
//but RestaurantCardMenu component work is to only display Restaurant data, so here for where is data came from this component have not bother it So we make a custom hook "useRestaurantMenu()" That will fetch data and we make into Utility function.


//Always make separate file for new Hook into Utility
//Always start with "use"
