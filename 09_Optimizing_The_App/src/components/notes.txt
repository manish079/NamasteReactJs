distribute code into small small part and make modular fashion I we follow single responsible principle code 
 So code will be easy for maintain and testing and Reusable code

// Custom Hooks (We make customs hooks for single responsible code)
//In the end of the hooks is normal utility function

//eg. in RestaurantCardMenu component I used a useEffect and then after I am set data on UI.
//but RestaurantCardMenu component work is to only display Restaurant data, so here for where is data came from this component have not bother it So we make a custom hook "useRestaurantMenu()" That will fetch data and we make into Utility function.


//Always make separate file for new Hook into Utility
//Always start with "use"


How to make custom hook
  //finalize the contract 
  // what is input and output


  ----------------------------------
If we want to build small application then we can no issue with single javascript file. (check in network and select JS)

but for large application we need to do make multiple JS files

make bundles for different parts into big application
we split large application into smaller bundlers

(All are same below )
  - chunking
  - Code splitting
  - dynamic bundling
  - lazy loading
  - on demand loading
